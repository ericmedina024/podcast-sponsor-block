| PODCAST_YOUTUBE_API_KEY                     | A [YouTube API key](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started) used to communicate with the YouTube API                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Yes      |               |
| PODCAST_DATA_PATH                           | The directory to store data in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Yes      |               |
| PODCAST_CATEGORIES_TO_REMOVE                | A comma-seperated list of [SponsorBlock categories](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#sponsorblock-options) to remove when downloading audio                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | No       | sponsor       |
| PODCAST_ALIAS_\<alias\>                     | Allows the configuration of aliases to make referencing playlists easier (example: `PODCAST_ALIAS_SCOOTS=PLMdYRoC0mZlW2uoesMXUrac26lsvOupSx` would allow you to reference the playlist `PLMdYRoC0mZlW2uoesMXUrac26lsvOupSx` with the name `scoots` instead)                                                                                                                                                                                    | No       |               |
| PODCAST_AUTH_KEY                            | Enables HTTP basic authentication on the server. `PODCAST_AUTH_KEY` will be used as the password (the username is ignored)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | No       |               |
| PODCAST_ALLOW_QUERY_PARAM_AUTH              | Allows `PODCAST_AUTH_KEY` to be provided as the query parameter `key`. Please note providing sensitive info as part of the query string [is bad practice](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Information_exposure_through_query_strings_in_url), so only enable this option if your podcast app does not support HTTP basic authentication. When enabled, podcast-sponsor-block will do its best to redact the key from its logs. | No       | false         |
| PODCAST_APPEND_AUTH_PARAM_TO_RESOURCE_LINKS | Causes the feed generator to include `key=<PODCAST_AUTH_KEY>` in resource links. This can only be enabled if `PODCAST_ALLOW_QUERY_PARAM_AUTH` is enabled, and is intended to be used only when it is required to workaround a lack of authentication support in your podcast app.                                                                                                                                                              | No       | false         |
| PODCAST_TRUSTED_HOSTS                       | A comma-seperated list of trusted `Host` header values that can be used to access podcast-sponsor-block (e.g. `http://192.168.1.43:8081,https://podcasts.ericmedina024.com`). If configured, the `Host` header will be used to create absolute URLs. If not configured, relative URLs will be used instead which can cause issues with some podcast apps.                                                                                      | No       |               |

### Custom thumbnails
Unfortunately, the YouTube API does not provide access to the cover image of podcasts. Due to this,
podcast-sponsor-block will use the channel's avatar as the podcast thumbnail by default. This is often different
from the usual cover image for the podcast.

If you don't like the thumbnail podcast-sponsor-block grabs, you can provide
a custom thumbnail by creating a `thumbnails` directory in `PODCAST_DATA_PATH`. Once created, put your desired
thumbnail image in a file with the same name as the YouTube playlist ID the thumbnail is for (file extensions are
ignored). You can also use your configured aliases as the file name. For example, if you had the alias
`PODCAST_ALIAS_SCOOTS=PLMdYRoC0mZlW2uoesMXUrac26lsvOupSx` configured, then you could name the thumbnail image 
`scoots.<extension>` or `PLMdYRoC0mZlW2uoesMXUrac26lsvOupSx.<extension>`.
